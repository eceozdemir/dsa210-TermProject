# dsa210-TermProject


Project Overview


In this project, I will analyze the relationship between the daily energy (kWh) charged to my Tesla vehicle and the weather conditions on that day. The goal is to explore whether certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) influence the amount of energy I charge into my car. Understanding this relationship could help identify patterns in energy consumption behavior depending on environmental factors.


Hypothesis 

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between daily weather conditions and the amount of energy (kWh) charged to the Tesla.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant relationship between daily weather conditions and the amount of energy (kWh) charged to the Tesla.

Description of Dataset

Energy charged (kWh): Daily energy data will be obtained through the Tesla, showing how much electricity I charged into the car each day.

Weather conditions: Daily weather data including temperature, humidity, precipitation, snowfall, and wind speed will be collected using the Open-Meteo API.

Date: Each record will be associated with the exact date, allowing day-level granularity and matching between both datasets.
