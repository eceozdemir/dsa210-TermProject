# dsa210-TermProject


Project Overview


This project explores how daily weather conditions influence the amount of energy (in kWh) charged into my Tesla vehicle. The goal is to understand how environmental factors affect electric vehicle behavior. It is expected that colder weather leads to more frequent charging sessions, whereas warmer weather is associated with increased travel activity compared to colder days.

Hypotheses
My hypothesis is that colder and rainier weather conditions, which reduce battery efficiency, might lead to longer or more frequent charging sessions.

Data Sources

1.Tesla Charging Data (via Teslascope):


-Date: Date of the charging session

-Charge_kWh: Amount of energy charged in kWh
 
2.Weather Data (?OpenWeatherMap API.)

   
-Use API (penWeatherMap) to get weather data
