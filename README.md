Project Overview


This project aims to investigate the relationship between phone screen time and studying hours.  The objective is to analyze weather increased phone usage impacts study duration and efficiency. By collecting and analyzing data on daily screen time and study hours, this project seeks to determine if excessive screen time is correlated with reduced academic productivity.


Hypotheses

- First hypothesis: Increased phone screen time is associated with lower total study hours.  
- Second hypothesis: Higher screen time before studying negatively impacts study efficiency.
